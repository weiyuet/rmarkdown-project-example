# Cache la Poudre River

The Cache la Poudre River is located east of the Continental Divide, in the northern Front Range of Colorado. It is affectionately known as the "Poudre" by local residents and long-time visitors to the area. The main and south forks of the Poudre originate in Rocky Mountain National Park, then flow north and east through the Roosevelt National Forest. The river eventually passes through the City of Fort Collins, then joins the south Platte River east of Greeley.

Station operated by the U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with [City of Fort Collins.](https://www.fcgov.com/) This station is managed by the Lakewood Field Office.

## Data Collection and Plots

Data from [USGS 06752260 CACHE LA POUDRE RIVER AT FORT COLLINS, CO](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/usa/nwis/uv?06752260)

### Data Download

```{r downloader}
q <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = "06752260",
                parameterCd = "00060",
                startDate = "1990-01-01",
                endDate = "2021-03-31") %>% 

rename(q = "X_00060_00003")
```

### Data Plot

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(q, aes(x = Date, y = q)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Discharge of the Poudre River, Fort Collins",
       x = "",
       y = "Q (cfs)") +
  theme_light()
```

### Interactive Data Plot

```{r}
#indicate time-series data
q_xts <- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date)

dygraph(q_xts) %>% 
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)")
```

# Results

  - The river has detailed discharge records going back decades.
  
  - Curious about the low discharge volume in the 2000s.
  
  - Curious about the spike in 2013.
  
  - Curious about the yearly seasonal spikes.
