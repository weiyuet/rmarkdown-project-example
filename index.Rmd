# Cache la Poudre River

The Cache la Poudre River is located east of the Continental Divide, in the northern Front Range of Colorado. It is affectionately known as the "Poudre" by local residents and long-time visitors to the area. The main and south forks of the Poudre originate in Rocky Mountain National Park, then flow north and east through the Roosevelt National Forest. The river eventually passes through the City of Fort Collins, then joins the south Platte River east of Greeley.

## Data Collection and Plots

### Data Download

```{r downloader}
q <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = "06752260",
                parameterCd = "00060",
                startDate = "2017-01-01",
                endDate = "2020-03-31") %>% 

rename(q = "X_00060_00003")
```

### Data Plot

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(q, aes(x = Date, y = q)) +
  geom_line() +
  ylab("Q (cfs)") +
  xlab(NULL) +
  ggtitle("Discharge of the Poudre River, Fort Collins") +

### Interactive Data Plot

```{r}
#indicate time-series data
q_xts <- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date)

dygraph(q_xts) %>% 
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)")
```
